      <p>In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees. If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako. It's cold, but it's beautiful. Let the paint work. We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all.</p>

<p>Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it. Maybe, just to play a little, we'll put a little tree here. You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush.</p>

<p>You need the dark in order to show the light. You are only limited by your imagination. This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it. There we go.</p>
